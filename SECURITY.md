Reporting Security Issues and Vulnerabilities
=============================================

At the Selenium project we take security seriously. Whether it is the code we write or the dependencies we 
use, security is always extremely important. 

Please do not open an issue or pull request as this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone 
including malicious actors. 

Security issues in this project can be safely reported via the the following 
address:

    [security@seleniumhq.org](mailto:security@seleniumhq.org)

In the report, please provide a [concise reproducible test case](http://sscce.org/) and describe 
what results you are seeing and what results you expect.

A member of the Selenium project will be notified and will begin the triage process.

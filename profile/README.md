## The Selenium Project

Selenium automates browsers. That's it! 🎉

What you do with that power is entirely up to you 💪

Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is 
certainly not limited to just that 🤖

Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well 🧰
